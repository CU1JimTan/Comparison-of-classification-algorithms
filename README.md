# Comparative-analysis-on-classification-algorithms

Various classification algorithms were applied to a same dataset and a comparitive study on each of their performace is done. Machine learning libraries of R programming is used for the study. 10 fold cross validation and effect of parameter changes on each algorithm is carefully studied reported. Every algorithms is compared on three evaluation metrics accuracy, precision and recall
