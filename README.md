# Comparative-analysis-on-classification-algorithms

Various classification algorithms were applied to a same dataset and a comparitive study on each of their performace is done using R programming. 
Following machine learning libraries of R is used for the study:
library(e1071)
library(ROCR)
library(randomForest)
library(rpart)
library(neuralnet)
library(ipred)
library(adabag)
library(caret)
library(ada)
library(gbm)
library(class)
library(ROCR)

10 fold cross validation and effect of parameter changes on each algorithm is carefully studied reported.
